**ATHENS+** is a transport guide app that focuses on making navigation simple and straightforward for tourists and residents of Athens alike. The app tackles the biggest problem with navigating Athens: needing to search around the web for bus information, metro lines, and general info on how to navigate around the city. ATHENS+ is the ultimate guide to bring with you on your way to Athens, providing a visual representation of the Metro/Bus/Tram Lines, instant directions with real-time transport info, easy-to-use navigation, and much more.

## Introduction to the app
**ATHENS+** is my first solo Android project. The goal is to create the most comprehensive transportation guide for navigating Athens using metro lines, bus lines, etc. It provides a visual depiction of the Athens Metro and Bus system that cannot be found in any other transportation app (not even Google Maps). The information gets pulled in real-time, providing accurate information and making it a simple 3-click task to go from point A to point B. Navigating Athens needs a minimum of 3 apps in order to find bus times, metro lines, how to walk to each station, and how the directions of each line work. This can not only be confusing for a tourist but also borderline annoying. This project fits all this information in 1 single application through Google's API and other OpenMapAPIs to deliver the most simple, straightforward, and easy-to-use transport app for both tourists and residents of Athens. The app was created as a side-project along with my university studies in my attempt to learn practical uses of Kotlin/Java and write my first solo project without AI and without "vibe-coding" or any external help, to solidify my developer position and surpass others who rely on tools to create their work. This is a personal goal of mine as well as an ongoing fight with getting better at coding applications with real-world use cases, and also bringing to life an idea that I have not yet seen implemented on the market. ATHENS+ is a project that carries the weight of my will to create the best product I possibly can and I will make sure that is 100% visible throughout the development of the app.

## What I use

ATHENS+ is built using:

- OpenTransport API
- Google Maps API
- Static JSON information with live updaters.
- Firebase (currently in development)

## Setup

To run the app on your own device, clone inside Android Studio:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tsopelas/ATHENSPLUS.git
```
And manually build APK onto your own device/emulation system. Prefer newer devices with latest Android since testing has not been done on older devices since the app is still in development.

## Future Development

You can manually look through my progress each week. I am trying to add a couple features per week if possible, from minor to more important ones. The main priority right now is to finish the directions feature and then I will move on to coding the Bus Lines and Tram.
